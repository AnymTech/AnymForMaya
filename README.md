### Video Tutorial

### Step-by-Step Workflow

#### 1. Setup
- **Enter your API key** in the designated field within the plugin interface

#### 2. Import Character
- Select a pose from the **"Available Pose:"** dropdown menu
- Click **"Import Armature"** to bring the character into your scene
- All imported armatures include IK/FK switch setups by default

#### 3. Create Key Poses
- **Pose your character** using the provided IK and FK handles along with the master control
- **Set keyframes** as you normally would in Maya (**S** hotkey)
  - Use the red triangle next to attributes in the coordinate tab to create keyframes
- Create as many key poses as needed for your animation

#### 4. Generate Animation
- Once your key poses are set, click **"Generate Animation"**
- The **browser-based previewer** will open automatically
- On first use, you'll be prompted to enter login credentials

#### 5. Preview and Iterate
- Review the generated animation in the browser previewer
- If not satisfied, return to Maya and:
  - Adjust your poses
  - Add or modify keyframes
  - Click "Generate Animation" again
- **Repeat this process** until you're happy with the motion

#### 6. Export Your Animation
- In the browser previewer, click **"Unlock Animation"**
- **Name your animation** if desired
- Navigate to the **"Unlocked Animations"** tab
- Click **"Export Animation"**

#### 7. Import to Maya
- Return to the Maya plugin
- Click **"Fetch Exported Animation"**
- Your generated animation will be imported into your Maya scene
- The animation can now be **retargeted and processed** just like traditional mocap data
